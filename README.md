## IPEval
IPEval is a pioneering bilingual Intellectual Property (IP) agency consultation evaluation benchmark, meticulously crafted to assess the competencies of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the intricate domain of intellectual property. This benchmark is the first of its kind, encompassing a diverse spectrum of 2,657 multiple-choice questions that are intricately divided across four major capability dimensions: creation, application, protection, and management. More details can be found in our paper.

## How to Evaluate on IPEval
You can directly obtain the text generated by the model and use our provided script (extract_answer.py) to extract the answer tokens (i.e., A, B, C, D, E). However, in zero-shot evaluation, it may be necessary to include human screening because the model, especially those that have not undergone instruction tuning, may not follow the instructions well enough to produce well-formatted text outputs.

We use the following prompt for testing:
